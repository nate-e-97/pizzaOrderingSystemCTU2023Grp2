                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Our family loves pizza. However... we weren't in love with the poor quality, pre cooked ingredients that we were putting in our body.
                We saw this as a chance to give pizza the love it deserves. While sticking with our family roots of locally inspired, and classically crafted food.
                We dreamed of a pizzeria that brought a warm and cozy ambience to the neighborhood.
                While are pizzas are simple and easy, we strive for quality. We are also proud to serve a nice selection of locally brewed craft beers.
                We see our pizza joint as an opportunity to contribute and be a part of the local community.
